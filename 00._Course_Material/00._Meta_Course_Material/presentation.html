## Terminology

**The semester repository**: This repository is where all the course material is. It will serve as the main repository for the semester.

**The simulation**: The simulation will simulate real-world web traffic to your website. 

**The project**: Throughout the semester you will work on a single project and this is also what you defend at the exam. Scale down your expectations significantly regarding implementing a search engine.


## Reading

There is only a bit of literature to read in this course. 

There is a lot of course material and I expect everyone to read all of it well. Even if you are not the one to have implemented the task you should've at least read and understood the assignment.

## Course workload

**Workload**: There is a steep work load in the beginning. It's supposed to become easier towards the end which should fit well with the idea of DevOps. You should create a lot of automation which allows you to lean back later on.  

**Complexity**: The topics are relatively simple in the beginning. Becomes more complex and difficult to implement later on. 

## Group work

Everyone must actively participate in the group work and commit. Prior to the exam we will run a script to investigate repository activity on a student basis.  

Use the fact that you work in groups to your advantage. Support each other. Share knowledge. 

I don't expect everyone to know exactly how something was implemented but I expect all group members to take shared responsibility for the project. This means that the exam will focus on **why** a choice was made, what advantages and disadvantages you predicted in advance and what you learned from it.


## [Whoknows variations](https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations)

For select few topics you will be provided step-by-step tutorials. 

Flask variations are optional in the sense that it is not required to attend the exam. However, I recommend that everyone tries to follow the tutorials for themselves, even if it isn't used in the exam project. They aim to teach you useful skills.

These tutorials are meant to be as simple as possible. There are better practices and more professional approaches. For the exam you will be evaluated on your knowledge on these practices, personal reflections and your group's implementation. 

Therefore, feel free to deviate from the tutorials if you found a better way. Your grade will reflect your level of ambition. The tutorials exist as a fallback so that no group gets left behind. 

## Assignments

Assignments aim to follow this structure:

```markdown
# [[Optional]] Assignment title

Summary / tagline

**Type**: Individual, Group work

**Soft Deadline/Hard Deadline/No Deadline**: 

[**Motivation**: Why you want to complete this task.]

[**Part of mandatory I/II**]
[**Part of the exam report**]


[## Requirement]
```

Square brackets indicate that the element is optional.

For the type:

- Individual: I want everyone to engage with the assignment alone and learn how to do it or learn from it.

- Group work: You are free to delegate the work, however, everyone is still expected to understand the assignment and how your group solved it.


## Lecture structure

A lecture day will typically consist of a presentation of a new topic with hands-on class work. 

By the end of it, you get the chance to ask questions. If you have questions then please write them down so you can remember to ask them during the designated Q+A.

Some days you might get some time to coordinate group work. 

## Course overall structure

Thhis is a preliminary plan that definitely will change. Do **NOT** rely on this plan. The idea is that you can look at the topics and get a sense of where the course is heading.

| Week | Topics                                        |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Intro + Tools                                |
| 2    | Rest API, OpenAPI, GitHub Actions            |
| 3    | Cloud, Azure, Deploy!                        |
| 4    | CI (Linting)                                 |
| 5    | Docker, The Simulation, Postman Monitors     |
| 6    | CD, Agile, DevOps                            |
| 7    | Eficode Sofus (External lecturer)            |
| 8    | Testing, Security                            |
| 9    | Databases, Datascraping / Webcrawling        |
| 10   | Searching, Logging, Monitoring               |
| 11   | Infrastructure as Code                       |
| 12   | Orchestration, Deployment Strategies         |
| 13   | Buffer                                       |
| 14   | Finalize the project. The simulation is taken down. |
| 15   | Report                                       |
| 16   | Report + Exam preparation                    |


If you feel like something isn't being covered which is blocking you or it should be covered earlier then please let me know.


## Teams

#### Remember!!!! Communication is crucial. And this is crucial, if you tell me early that something is difficult and most of the class agrees, then I will be lenient on you and consider how I can make it easier. If am told at the exam or close to it then I will not. 


Teams subchannels:

| Channel Name     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General**      | Course material and course information.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Assignments**  | For the mandatories and handing in missed assignments.                                                                                                         |
| **Not in a group** | For group formation since it is an exam requirement to be in a group of 3-4 people.                                                                           |
| **Course_Help**        | I will happily respond to questions here. Especially things regarding the course material, big or small. This involves questions about the course meta, the course material, the tutorials (e.g., "I don't understand this tutorial at all, I am stuck and I think it's the tutorial's fault"), the assignments, etc. If you are using what feels like an unreasonable amount of time on a tutorial then the problem is probably not you. Please don't hold back. |
| **Help_Each_Other**         | The purpose of this channel is to give you a free space to communicate in. You can write to each other for help or even inspiration. I will not be as active, and you can help each other across groups here. You can @ me or take it to A_Q+A if you had a discussion involving multiple people and everyone is stuck. This is for help with setup, debugging, etc. |


## Choices and challenges

Create a group document for choices and challenges.

The document doesn't have to be long but enough for you to look up later and recall the challanges. 

**Motivation**: This will help knowledge share across your team. It is also good advice for your main thesis. Show the work!

### Choices

For every major problem you encountered, you must:

- Write down how you made the choice

- Write down relevant considerations your group had 

- Reflect in retrospect on the pros and cons of your choice


### Challenges

For every major choice you've made, you must:

- Write down the considerations you had regarding other choices

- Reflect on the pros and cons of the choice as you make it

- Later on add a reflection on how the choice turned out and unexpected consequences


## PR competition!

I really want you to take ownership of the course material and interact with it critically. 

Make Pull Requests to suggest changes. It can be anything from fixing typos, improving explanations or tutorials etc. 

The one person who has the most accepted PRs by the end of the course will receive a prize.

# About the exam

Read more about the official [course requirements](https://katalog.kea.dk/course/3050407/2024-2025).

Everything in the link above holds true, but additional information can be found below. 

---

## Collaboration

While it's a group exam you will be graded individually. 

An important part of this course is to learn to work together. It's not just about technologies. Culture is one of the keystones of what it means to be DevOps.

---

## The deployment

What is interesting is that the life span of the application is known in advance. 

You can take down the services once the simulation stops. 

The system must be deployed during the exam. This might mean that you will run out of credit if you are only using a single students' account. 

Don't worry about this part yet. You will learn how to make your life easier the second time around. 

---

## Solution agnostic

During the lectures and the guides focus on a certain way of doing DevOps. 

Don’t wanna use GitHub Actions and want to use CI/CD tools (Travis CI, Jenkins etc.) instead? Great!

Don’t want to use Terraform and want to use Vagrant or Serverless Framework etc.? Great!

That's why I have provided the requirements mentioned below. 

---

## Requirements

I have provided some documents containing the minimum requirements for the exam. Your grade will depend on how much work you put into the project.

I also provide suggestions and guides on how to implement certain things. You can consider them as a fallback if you are stuck. 

What will elevate you is if your group either makes great choices based on research or gain a fresh understanding of the different approaches, the pros and cons of each. Basically, reflecting on your choices. 

The requirement documents are:

- [Exam requirements](./exam_requirements.md)
- [Exam report requirements](./exam_requirements_report.md)


---

# Exam requirements

This document is a list of the pure requirements described in a way that allows you to choose other technologies.

You must have all your group data filled out in the `repositories.py` file. This must be done exactly when you are asked to do it in the course preparation.

---

## Meta-requirement: Group work

Everyone should be involved and participate in the project weekly.

I will run a script to assert that everyone has contributed. This is for people who aren't participating much in their group. This isn't a measuring contest. We are just trying to create a fair landscape of who did nothing in the group.

The graphs will also help us spot anomalies such as unbalanced work effort throughout the semester. So please avoid last-minute cramming. The course tries to coexist with other electives.

---

## Tech stack

The server must be rewritten in another framework. You are not allowed to use `Flask`, `Express` or `Spring Boot`.

---

## Organization

Use version control.

Employ a branching strategy.

Have a way to manage issues.

---

## Code quality

Ensure code quality (static analysis / linting).

You must perform testing.

---

## Automation

Use a CI pipeline.

If you don't have a CD pipeline, you must have a plan for how you would automate deployment.

---

## Deployment

Your application must be deployed to a Virtual Machine or similar. Services like Web Apps or PaaS like Vercel etc. are great and easy to use, but it removes your chance to learn and reach the course goals.

While not required to implement it, you must've discussed scaling and an optimal deployment strategy in your groups.

---

## Production

Your system should be deployed for the exam.

---

## Monitoring

You must have monitoring.

---

## Documentation

To your best ability, create thorough documentation.

---

## Learning goals

The learning goals are designed to help you understand at what level you should know the content.

While the general content of the slides is mandatory knowledge, sources and external links (included in the slides) are not required reading unless explicitly mentioned in the semester plan.

---

## Use of language models

This course encourages you to use tools that might aid you in coding, debugging and correctly configuring your systems.

However, do **not** use AI to write the report. Even with proper prompting language models don't seem to be able to write in the concise manner required without losing meaning. The report is an excercise in trying to formulate the subject in a way that forces you to cut down to the heart of the subjects and what matters in this course.


---

# Exam report requirements

The exam report is written by the group and will be read by me and the censor. 

---

## Requirements

**Deadline**: Since hand-in is over Wiseflow, check there to see when the deadline has been set. I do not control this.

**Length**: Max 8 pages

**Language**: Danish/English

## Report formalities

Include: 

- Group name and student names with kea mail

- Page numbers

**Justify margins**: The entire report text (except titles) must be justified on both sides. To get you started, here is how you can do it in Google Docs and Word:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGExqD1PIFE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CUF3bgazCE&themeRefresh=1

Justifying text helps readability and gives the report a professional look. 

---

## Sections to include

Since the mandatories specify a set of documents that you must bring to the exam, it would be interesting to allow you complete freedom for the exam report. 

Giving an overview of the setup with diagram(s) is a good start, though.

My advice: Keep it concise!
