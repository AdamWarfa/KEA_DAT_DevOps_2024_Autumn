# The story 

A group of students tried to develop a search engine in 2009 with the latest technology at its time. 

They called it: `Â¿Who Knows?`.

---

# What they managed to create

 - a backend

 - a frontend

 - an SQLite database (containing scraped Wikipedia articles about programming)

# But it was abandoned

After they presented their main thesis in January 2010, the project was abandoned.

The stack is outdated and the code is not maintained.

The code is in many ways flawed. 

The database contains outdated content from that date or prior. 

Your group will inherit their legacy code. But it's too much to rewrite it in one go. We need CI/CD pipelines to help us rewrite in increments. 

---

# It will be your job to:

  - Analyze the code for flaws

  - Modernize the stack

  - Update the database content


But as a starting point, we need to get the code.

# The only thing we managed to dig up

 - An IP address. 

 - Username

 - Password

Question: *Now what?*

---

# SSH

```bash
ssh <username>@<ip_address>
```

<!-- Optionally, to force it to use password instead of key (this might not be needed for you): 

```
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o <username>@<ip_address>
```
-->

Username: `monkgroup`

Password: `blackmonktime!`

IP address: `52.178.191.100`

# How do we check if anything is running? And on which port?

There are multiple ways to do it. 

*Can you think of one?*

---

# **P**rocess **s**tatus with `ps`

List all processes:

```bash
$ sudo ps aux
```

Too much output. Let's filter with `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print):

```bash
$ sudo ps aux | grep python
```

Maybe not so useful. 


---

# List open files

The `-i` flag specifies network files. 

```bash
$ sudo lsof -i
```

The port is listed as: `*:http-alt`

<details> 
  <summary>Question: What port is that?</summary>
    Port 8080
</details>

Or use the network ports flag (`-nP`) to see the port number. 

```bash
$ sudo lsof -i -nP
```

---

# Doing it again with `netstat`

```bash
$ sudo netstat -tuln
```

`t`: TCP

`u`: UDP

`l`: listening to ports

`n`: numeric output (no DNS lookup)

---

# Where is the code?

---

# We found some code

How do we get it locally?

---

# Secure copy

From your local machine (not ssh'd), run this command:

```bash
$ scp -r <username>@<ip_address>:/path/to/directory /path/to/destination
```

The `-r` flag is required because we are retrieving a directory.

Replace `/path/to/directory` with `/home/`. Try to figure out the rest. 

---

# Let's run it

Problems?

---

# Python version

Write Python in your terminal and hit `tab` to see suggestions. What do you see?

In my tutorials I might write `python` instead of `python3`.

That's because, I have an alias that runs the latest version of Python 3 when I type `python`.

You can consider setting that up too. 


---

# `Make`

A build automation tool. Allows us to run commands. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)

Actions are defined in a `Makefile`.

Can you find it?

---

# Install `make`

Comes with *nix. The following is only needed for Windows users: 

```powershell
$ choco install make
```

---

# Run using `make`

Execute the command where the makefile is located. 

```bash
$ make run
```

*Problems?*

---

# We didn't get the database

*Where is the database?*

*What is the command to get it?*

---

# Getting the database 

```bash
$ scp monkgroup@<ip_address>:/tmp/whoknows.db .
```

---

# Any more snooping suggestions?
