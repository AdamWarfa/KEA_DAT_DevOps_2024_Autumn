# The course repository

About the course.

<!-- todo link to the repository and go through  -->


---

# Motivation - Why you would want to work hard at this course

Good preperation for your internship next semester. 

Closest to real life. Most lessons learned will prove useful in your professional career. 

---

# Group work

Let's form groups!

# What is DevOps?

We aim to be able to answer this by the end of the course. It won't be the focus until a couple of weeks in.

But let it be know, that you have not done DevOps at KEA yet. 

DevOps is not a protected title and the understanding of it has changed through the years.

---

# Is it DevOps?

DevOps is **not** just technology. It's **culture**. But...

<img src="./assets/devops_technologies.png" alt="devops 8" style="height: 35vh;">

[Source](https://shalb.com/blog/what-is-devops-and-where-is-it-applied/)

Just like how being 10% agile doesn't make you agile at all. 

A good gauge is to ask, "How do you monitor?" 

---

# The exam question - Are we DevOps?

At the exam you will be expected to reflect as a team and answer these two questions:

1. What made you DevOps?

2. In what ways were you not DevOps?



---


# This is how it all started


---

# The story 

A group of students tried to develop a search engine in 2009 with the latest technology at its time. 

They called it: `Â¿Who Knows?`. 

<img src="./assets/monkgroup.png" alt="monk group legacy team" style="height: 45vh;">


---

# What they managed to create

 - a backend

 - a frontend

 - an SQLite database (containing scraped Wikipedia articles about programming)

---

# Website screenshot

<img src="./assets/whoknows_website.png" alt="whoknows website screenshot">


---

# But it was abandoned

After they presented their main thesis in January 2010, the project was abandoned.

The stack is outdated and the code is not maintained.

The code is in many ways flawed. 

The database contains outdated content from that date or prior. 

Your group will inherit their legacy code. But it's too much to rewrite it in one go. We need CI/CD pipelines to help us rewrite in increments. 

---

# It will be your job to:

  - Analyze the code for flaws

  - Modernize the stack

  - Update the database content


But as a starting point, we need to the code. 

---

<div class="title-card">

</div>

---

# The only thing we managed to dig up

<!-- todo  update the IP Address -->
 - An IP address. 

 - Username

 - Password

Question: *Now what?*

---

# SSH

```bash
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password <username>@<ip_address>
```

Note: The `-o` flag might be optional for you. 

Username: `monkgroup`

Password: `blackmonktime!`


---

# How do we check if anything is running? And on which port?

There are multiple ways to do it. 

*Can you think of one?*

---

# **P**rocess **s**tatus with `ps`

List all processes:

```bash
$ sudo ps aux
```

Too much output. Let's filter with `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print):

```bash
$ sudo ps aux | grep python
```

Maybe not so useful. 


---

# List open files

The `-i` flag specifies network files. 

```bash
$ sudo lsof -i
```

The port is listed as: `*:http-alt`

<details> 
  <summary>Question: What port is that?</summary>
    Port 8080
</details>

Or use the network ports flag (`-nP`) to see the port number. 

```bash
$ lsof -i -nP
```

---

# Doing it again with `netstat`

```bash
$ sudo netstat -tuln
```

`t`: TCP

`u`: UDP

`l`: listening to ports

`n`: numeric output (no DNS lookup)

---

# Where is the code?

---

# We found some code

How do we get it locally?

---

# Secure copy

```bash
$ scp -r <username>@<ip_address>:/path/to/file /path/to/destination
```

The `-r` flag is required because we are retrieving a directory.

---

# Let's run it

Problems?

---

# Python version

Write Python in your terminal and hit `tab` to see suggestions. What do you see?

In my tutorials I might write `python` instead of `python3`.

That's because, I have an alias that runs the latest version of Python 3 when I type `python`.

You can consider setting that up too. 


---

# `Make`

A build automation tool. Allows us to run commands. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)

Actions are defined in a `Makefile`.

Can you find it?

---

# Install `make`

Comes with *nix. The following is only needed for Windows users: 

```powershell
$ choco install make
```

---

# Run using `make`

Execute the command where the makefile is located. 

```bash
$ make run
```

---

# We didn't get the database

Where is the database?

---

# Getting the database 

```bash
$ scp monkgroup@<ip_address>:/tmp/whoknows.db .
```

---

# Any more snooping suggestions? 






---

# We now enter start-up mode

The most exciting times with lots of small tasks to do!

---

# What now?

If time permits, this is how we aim to finish every week.

  1. Q+A session based on previous week's work (prepare questions ahead of class)

  2. Go through all the course work + Q+A session

  3. Coordinate with your groups (if time allows)
