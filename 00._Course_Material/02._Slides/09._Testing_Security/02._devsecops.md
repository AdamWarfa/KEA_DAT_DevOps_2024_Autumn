# How is DevSecOps different from DevOps + Security?

Security becomes part of every step of CI/CD.

All developers become responsible of security.

The security team becomes advisors rather than police.

# GDPR

Inform the affected parties (users). Inform the authorities.

In the simulation, I do not expect you to adhere to GDPR if there is a data leak. Please don't contact datatilsynet.
