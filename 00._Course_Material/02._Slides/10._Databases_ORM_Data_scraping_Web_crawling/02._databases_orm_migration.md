# What is the most important thing to remember when choosing a database?

---

# It should be the right choice for your use case

There are many other arguments to consider, but if the above condition is not satisfied then the rest is irrelevant.

# PostgreSQL vs. MySQL

MySQL is a proprietary database, while PostgreSQL is open-source. 

Scalability and high available features for MySQL are locked behind the Enterprise Edition.  

MySQL is more used, historically, but that's changing as PostgreSQL is [the preferred choice today](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-databases).

PostGreSQL supports JSON and JSONB data types, while MySQL has limited support.

# How migrations can help you

From the assignment:

1. Changes to the schema. Propagating the change for the developers or in production.

2. Migrating data from SQLite to the new database.

3. Backing up the database. (Better solutions might exist here depending on your chosen database).

Once you implement web scraping and web crawling, you might need to migrate data from the web to your database.
