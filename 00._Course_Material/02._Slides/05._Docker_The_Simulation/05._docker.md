# Docker terminology?

**Image**

**Container**

**Volume**

**Networking**

*Can you give informal definitions for these?*

---

# Docker terminology (informal)

**Image**: Blueprint / Recipe

**Container**: The instance of the image

**Volume**: Holds the data of the containers

**Networking**: Enables the pieces to speak


---

# Basic CLI example

Run the [hello-world container](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/) from DockerHub and delete it after its execution:

```bash
$ docker run --rm hello-world
```

---

# Overview with Redis example

[https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/](Redis is a popular key-value store). 

*Can you explain the following commands?*

```bash
$ docker pull redis
$ docker run redis
$ docker ps
```

Run in detached mode:

```bash
$ docker run -d redis
$ docker ps
$ docker stop <container-id>
```

---

# Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux) is a very lightweight Linux distribution.

Get an interactive [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) shell:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh
```

`-it` is short for `--interactive` and `--tty` (Pseudo-TTY).

Go back to the local terminal by typing `exit` in the container shell.

```bash
/ # exit
```

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Volumes</h1>
</div>

---

# Volumes

You can mount directories (volumes) from your host to a container using the `-v` flag.

1. Create a directory with a file in it locally:

```bash
$ mkdir mydockerdata
$ echo 'Hello from the host!' > ./mydockerdata/mountedfile.txt
```

2. Run an Alpine container and mount the directory:

```bash
$ docker run -it -v ./mydockerdata:/data alpine:latest /bin/sh
```

*Where can I find the file?*


---

# Volumes - II

*What happens if you delete the `mydockerdata` folder locally?* 

Let's try it. 


1. Find the container ID:

```bash
$ docker ps -a
```

2. Start the container and attach it to interact with it:

```bash
$ docker start <CONTAINER_ID>
$ docker attach <CONTAINER_ID>
```

In the container run:

```bash
$ cat /data/mountedfile.txt
```

---

# Create a volume with consistent file location for data

Create a volume:

```bash
$ docker volume create test-volume
```

Inspect where the volume is stored on the host:

```bash
$ docker volume inspect test-volume
```

On Windows 10 (running Docker with `WSL 2`), we can find the folder in the file explorer by typing this: `\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\data\docker\volume`


Use the volume in a container:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -v test-volume:/mydata alpine /bin/sh
```

---

# Why volumes?

*Can you give examples of what you would want to mount in a Docker container?*

---

# Volumes: That's why!

Database data:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest
```

Configuration files:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf nginx:latest
```

Sharing data between containers:

```bash
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/shared/data webserver:latest
$ docker run -d -v /my/local/data:/shared/data worker:latest
```

Source code, persistent storage for applications (fx. CMS), storing log files, SSL certificates, backup local data in a container etc.

    <h1>Docker Networking</h1>
</div>

# Docker Networking

Let's explore networks in Docker by creating a network and then have two containers join it.

Create a network:

```bash
$ docker network create mynetwork
```

Run two named containers on the `mynetwork` network:

```bash
$ docker run -dit --name container1 --network mynetwork alpine:latest
$ docker run -dit --name container2 --network mynetwork alpine:latest
```

---

# Verify networking between the containers

Run `container1` by attaching it:

```bash
$ docker attach container1
```
From `container1` ping `container2` (with example response):

```bash
/ # ping container2
PING container2 (172.18.0.3): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.3: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.075 ms
...
...
```

After a while stop the ping by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

If you see no packet loss, the containers are connected. Example:

```txt
--- container2 ping statistics ---
37 packets transmitted, 37 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.110/0.225/0.566 ms
```

---

# Expose ports to the host

Run an Nginx Container:

```bash
$ docker run -dit --name webserver --network mynetwork -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```

Check out `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.

In `container2` request the webserver on the same network (install CURL first):

```bash
/ # apk add curl
/ # curl http://webserver
```

Inspect the network to see which containers are connected and their IP addresses. 

```bash
$ docker network inspect mynetwork
```

---

# Clean up!

```bash
$ docker stop container1 container2 webserver
$ docker rm container1 container2 webserver
$ docker network rm mynetwork
```
