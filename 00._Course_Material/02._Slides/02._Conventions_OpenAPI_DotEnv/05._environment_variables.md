# A thorough discussion on the pros and cons of defining secrets in config files vs. environment variables

If you are interested:

https://serverfault.com/questions/892481/what-are-the-advantages-of-putting-secret-values-of-a-website-as-environment-var

We will work with environment variables defined in config files called dotenv. 

Dotenv exists across many languages. The standard is that the files are named `.env`.

---

# Defining it locally 

Let's use dotenv in Node.js and Python. 

---

# Create a template file!

Your `.env` should be added to .gitignore and never pushed. 

Create a copy of your `.env` file and remove the sensitive information but keep the keys and perhaps add example values. 

This file should be pushed. There is no single naming convention but usually they are called something similar to:

- `.env.example`
- `.env.sample`
- `.env.template`

*What is the purpose of doing this?*

# In GitHub Action - Manually

```yaml
name: Create .env file

on: [push]


jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        - name: Create .env file
          run: |
            echo "API_KEY=${{ secrets.ENV_API_KEY }}" >> .env
            echo "OTHER_SECRET=${{ secrets.ENV_OTHER_SECRET }}" >> .env
```

You don't *have* to prepend the secrets with `ENV_` but it's a nice way to show that they are different from other secrest and their purpose.

# In GitHub Action - Marketplace extension


Using [SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v2.0](https://github.com/SpicyPizza/create-envfile) is a very popular way of doing it:

```yaml
name: Create .env file

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create .env file
        uses: SpicyPizza/create-envfile@v2.0
        with:
          envkey_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ENV_API_KEY }}
          envkey_OTHER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ENV_OTHER_SECRET }}
          file_name: .env
```

---

# With docker-compose.yaml

**Example 1**: Defining environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    environment:
      - PUBLIC_KEY=publickey
      - NOT_SECRET=thisisnotsecret
```

**Example 2**: Defining secrets and reading them from .env files into the environment example:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    env_file:
      - /path/to/your/env/.env
```

Then access them in your programming language how you normally would.
