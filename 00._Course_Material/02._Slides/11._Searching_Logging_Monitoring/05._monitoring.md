# How would you achieve monitoring in every step?

# What is monitoring?

> Monitoring is for asking questions.

— Dave Josephsen, Monitorama 2016

> That is, monitoring doesn’t exist to generate alerts: alerts are just one possible outcome. With this in mind, remember that every metric you collect and graph does not need to have a corresponding alert.

\-  Mike Julian, Practical Monitoring, 2017

# Monitoring

While logging is about recording individual events, monitoring is about observing the system.

Monitoring aggregates numerical data over time from various events. 

* Number of HTTP requests processed.

* The total time spent processing requests.

* The number of requests being handled concurrently.

* The number of errors encountered.

* CPU, memory, and disk usage.

# Telemetry

Monitoring is not just about the health of the system.

Through telemetry we can adhere to a DevOps principle of **continuous learning**/**improving**.


---

# Types of monitoring

- **Health monitoring**: is the most basic form of monitoring. It checks if the system is up and running.
- **Performance monitoring**: checks the performance of the system.
- **Alerting**: notifies the team when something goes wrong.
- **Logging**: records events that happen in the system.
- **Tracing**: tracks the flow of a request through the system.
- **Profiling**: measures the performance of the system.
- **Auditing**: checks the system for compliance with security policies.
- **Business monitoring**: checks the system for compliance with business policies.

# Some of the things you can monitor

- **Application monitoring**

- **Infrastructure monitoring**

- **Real user monitoring**

# Specialized monitoring tools

  * Nagios https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-log-server/
  * Munin http://munin-monitoring.org/
  * Netdata https://my-netdata.io/
  * Shinken http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/

# Pull versus Push Monitoring

#### Pull/polling-based

Monitored sub-systems are queried.

Example: Nagios

#### Push-based

Hosts, services, and applications send data to a central collector.

Example: Prometheus, considered a push-based monitoring system or a hybrid as each monitored application pushes its metrics which are then pulled by the central Prometheus system.

# Monitoring the business

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) asks question such as:

* Are the numbers of active users growing, declining, or stagnant?
* Are the users happy?
* Can we/are we making money?
* Are we profitable?

Resulting in metrics such as:

* Net promoter score (likelyhood of a customer recommending your product)
* Revenue per customer
* Cost per customer
* Burn rate (how fast money is spent)

(Not a requirement in this course)

Record user interactions with the the website. What hinders them from go through a flow?

# ODD - Observability-Driven Development

> If Engineering at Etsy has a religion, it’s the Church of Graphs. If it moves, we track it. Sometimes we’ll draw a graph of something that isn’t moving yet, just in case it decides to make a run for it...  Tracking everything is key to moving fast, but the only way to do it is to make tracking anything easy...

\- Ian Malpass, Engineer at Etsy

# Reminder: Observability is not a substitute to testing!

Incidents in production are costly and hard to debug

---

# Monitoring should not be reacting to symptoms

Monitoring should be used to predict and prevent issues.

# Why do we **NOT** run our monitoring setup on the same server?

*Discuss in pairs*

---

# Why **NOT** - quote

> Monitoring is so important that our monitoring systems need to be more available and scalable than the systems being monitored

\- Adrian Cockcroft, Monitorama
