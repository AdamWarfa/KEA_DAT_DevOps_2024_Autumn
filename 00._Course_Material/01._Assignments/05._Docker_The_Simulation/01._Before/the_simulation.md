# Response times

Adhering to good rules of thumb, the response times are as following:

| Route        | Maximum Response Time (seconds) |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| /            | 10                              |
| /search      | 10                              |
| /weather     | 10                              |
| /register    | 10                              |
| /login       | 10                              |
| /api/search  | 6                               |
| /api/weather | 6                               |
