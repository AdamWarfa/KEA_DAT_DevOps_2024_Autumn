**Type**: Group work

**Deadline**: No fixed deadline.

## Introduction

This is an extension of the `research git branching strategies` assignment. With this assignment, you can enforce some rules regarding your chosen strategy. 

## What are branch protection rules?

Branch protection rules can, for instance, help secure the main branch so that it doesn't get accidentally broken.

Learn more about them here:

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule


## How to setup a branch protection rule

In this example, the rule requires at least 2 to review a pull request before being able to merge with main.

1. **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**: Navigate to your repository on GitHub. Click on the "Settings" tab at the top.
2. **üåø Branches**: In the settings menu, find and click on the "Branches" menu located on the left side.
3. **üîí Branch Protection Rules**: Scroll down to the "Branch protection rules" section.
4. **‚úèÔ∏è Edit**: Find the branch you want to set rules for and click on "Edit" (or "Add rule" if you're setting this up for the first time).
5. **üîÄ Require a Pull Request Before Merging**:
    - Check the option "Require a pull request before merging".
    - üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Required Number of Approvals**: Set the "Required number of approvals before merging" to **`2`**.
6. **‚úÖ Require Status Checks**:
    - Check "Require status checks to pass before merging".
    - üîç **Search and Select Status Checks**: Search for the specific status checks you want to require and select them.
7. **üíæ Save**: Once you're done setting up your rules, don't forget to save the changes.


## What other rules could be helpful?

Branch protection rules can help you enforce passing tests, limit who can push to a branch and more.

# Choose a git branching strategy

**Type**: Group work

**Part of mandatory I.**

---

## Exam requirement

For the exam your group will be expected to have picked a workflow and branching strategies.

Every group member should be able to talk about the chosen version control strategy and reflect on the pros and cons.

--- 

### Document for the mandatory

Create a document for the mandatory that answers the following questions:

- What version control strategy did you choose and how did you actually do it / enforce it?

- Why did your group chose the one you did? Why did you not choose others?

- What advantages and disadvantages did you run into during the course?

Feel free to revise the document even after deadline with new insights during the course.

# Consumer Report!

A consumer report has revealed a change in the market! 

**Type**: Group work

**Deadline**: Before the simulation next week. If you are pressed for time, just create the route that returns the correct response type and solve this task at a later date. 

---

## Description

Consumers have become highly interested in the weather recently. Create a weather page that displays the forecast. 

---

## Motivation

This is an excellent opportunity to: 

1. Integrate with a 3rd party service. 

2. Test the integration as part of your pipelines later on.

---

## Considerations

Research services that provide weather forecasts. Consider limitations such as cost and alloted API calls over a certain timeframe.

Decide on how to integrate with the service. Frontend or backend? Are any of the choices problematic in your setup? 

Consider scalability. How would you handle a large number of users without burdening the service? You don't have to solve anything here, but you should have a plan for it.

Consider limitations (alloted API calls over a certain timeframe) and how to possibly cache the result at a fixed interval.

  <summary>Spoiler to the scalability question</summary>
   Hint: Caching
</details>

---

<!-- todo future: consider creating a competition / graph for that group whose forecast is the most accurate  -->

# Linting

Enhance your CI pipleines with a static analysis tools.

**Type**: Group work

**Motivation**: Improve code quality with linting

---

## Considerations

Consider whether you want to ensure linting before anyone can push their code or make it part of a CI pipeline or both. 

---

## Tools

How to approach this task highly depends on the language you are using.

Here is a great collection of tools for every major language:

https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis

You could (additionally) consider SuperLinter:

# [Optional] Create a GitHub Badge for your GitHub Actions

*DevOps principle: Show your work!*

**Type**: Group work

---

## What are badges?

Badges can be added to the repository's README to visualize various things.

In this assignment, you will create a shield for a workflow so that you can see the status of it when looking at the frontpage of your repository. This makes sense for the CI task of this week. 

---

## Get started

To help you get started, place this template in your `README.md` file to show the status of a GitHub Action:

```markdown
![<TEXT ON SHIELD>](https://github.com/<ORGANISATION>/<REPOSITORY>/actions/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILENAME.yml>/badge.svg?branch=main)
```

Replace:

- `<TEXT ON SHIELD>` with the text you want to display on the shield (A good name would be the name of the workflow)
- `<ORGANISATION>` with your organisation's name
- `<REPOSITORY>` with the name of the repository that the GitHub Action is defined on
- `<WORKFLOW_FILENAME.yml>` with the **exact** name of the workflow file as it appears in the `.github/workflows` directory. 
- `?branch=main` is optional and can be removed to show the status across all branches. In this example only the status of the main branch will be shown. 

---

# Genereate a workflow status badge through the Github UI

You can also select a specific workflow execution in the actions tab and click on the three dots and `Create status badge` to generate a badge.

---

# [Optional] SuperLinter badge

Here is how you can create a Superlinter badge for your repository.

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter#add-super-linter-badge-in-your-repository-readme

---

# [Optional] Shields.io for more badges

Shields.io is a service that lets you create advanced custom badges:

https://shields.io/

For instance, you could use it to showcase the stack you are using. Check out the repistory if you are interested:

https://github.com/badges/shields

# Analyze software quality

Add maintainability and technical debt estimation tools to your projects and fix the most prominent issues.

**Type**: Group work

**Deadline**: Same as Mandatory II. Even though software quality is important, you can add this task to your kanban and do it later if you are swamped with higher priority tasks.

**Motivation**: Improve code quality and avoid technical debt.

---

## Task

These tools will analyze your code and provide you with a maintainability index and an estimation of the technical debt. 

They will also point out potential problems. You do not have to fix everything. But prominent issues that you agree on, should be fixed from now on.

They will also become part of your CI pipeline and you should try to keep the quality metrics high as you push new code. 

---

## SonarQube

The easiest way to get started with SonarQube is to use SonarCloud which is a readily available hosted version of SonarQube.

1. Navigate to https://sonarcloud.io/ and click the `Start Now -->` button. [Start Using SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) and login via GitHub.

2. Login via GitHub. 

3. Add a new project by clicking the `+` sign on the top right of the window followed by `Analyze new project`.

4. Select the repository or the repositories that you want to assess.

If you are interested, you can learn more about how SonarQube calculates metrics [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/metric-definitions/#header-4).

---

## Code Climate

1. Navigate to https://codeclimate.com/quality and click the `Sign up with Github` button.

2. Choose `Sign up with Github` again. 

3. Select the repositories that you want to assess.


---

## Requirement for Mandatory II

After you have setup a these code quality tools and gone through the issues, your group should create a brief document that answers the following questions:

  - Do you agree with the findings?

  - Which ones did you fix?

  - Which ones did you ignore?

  - Why?

While only one can setup the integration with SonarQube, everyone should be able to answer the questions above for the exam.

# [Optional] Whoknows Variations Continuous Integration

Learn about different tools for linting in Python and see an example of linting in Github Action. 

**Type**: Individual

---

## Description

This task is optional, since linting in Python might not be relevant for you. But it's a good introduction to the `whoknows_variations` project. 

You can inspect the code and check it out or you can run it/fork it if you feel like it.

Here is the correct branch for this task:
