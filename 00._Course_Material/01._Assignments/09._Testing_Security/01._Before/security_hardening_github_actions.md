## Reading material

Since it's important that all developers are aware of the security risks and best practices when using GitHub Actions, all group members should read the following documentation:

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions

If you make any changes after reading the documentation, then make a note of it or tell your group members about it.
