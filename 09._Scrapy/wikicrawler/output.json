Sometimes those cooperative efforts are mutual community agreement on article content, sometimes those efforts are by finding a dynamic balance between competing viewpoints.  But the community collaboration is greater than the sum of the individual contributors.\n", "Rude or uncivil behavior has direct negative effects on the community:\n", "Civility or personal attack warnings are not a tool to fight or win arguments or drive a consensus in one or another direction.  The validity of an argument on a factual or stylistic or logical basis is completely unrelated to whether the argument was made in a very polite and respectful way, or if it was made in a vile and horribly abusive way.

If that is happening, focus on that person's abusive edits, and keep those distinct from the content or policy arguments they are submitting.  If you combine comments on the underlying dispute with comments on the specific abusive edits, you increase the chance that the editor will reject the validity of your warning or complaint, and continue abusive behavior.\n", "If more than one person is making rude, abusive, or personal attack edits, don't take sides in the dispute.  Warnings should be issued:\n", "Again â avoid taking sides in the underlying content dispute. Occasionally, a warning mixed with a little acknowledgment of the offending editor's contributions can encourage cooperation.\n", "As with other Wikipedia policies, enforcement of most policies is done by community action.

If further action is required, such as a block of an account for ongoing problematic behavior, Wikipedia's volunteer administrators have to take that step.\n", "Anyone is empowered to get involved.

Just be cautious and respectful when you get involved.\n", "If you are involved in a heated argument or just do not like an editor who you see being uncivil, it is generally much to your advantage to let someone else handle the situation. If an accused party knows how you feel about them, they are less likely to accept the validity of any warning you make. You are less likely to make a good and fair warning that respects their value while letting them know they have caused a problem. The best response in this situation is to leave it to others to respond. If you do feel you must warn someone you're involved in a dispute with, do it very carefully, and make it clear what behavior or comment you think was inappropriate; separate out the civility problem from the underlying dispute. If you warn someone, it's best not even to mention the underlying dispute: just focus on the uncivil comment or action until that is resolved and defused.\n", "The best answer, however, is for involved parties to report rather than warn.

That happens less if the person leaving the notification or warning clearly articulates their sense of self (\"I think...\").\n", "Respond to them as a person, and try to be clear that you're expecting to be treated like a human being in response.  They're upset about something â we can sympathize with a feeling while being critical about a behavior or expression.\n", "Accusations and threats will make the typical editor defensive or retaliatory, focusing away from their abusive actions and on the person making the warning.  This is not a desirable outcome.\n", "The word \"you\" in warnings can often trigger defensive feelings and feelings of accusation.  It should be used carefully, and less prominently if possible.  It's hard to avoid it completely â when leaving a warning, you as the warner need to tie the actions to the person you are warning â but when you describe the effects of such words, it's better to do so in the abstract rather than the personal and accusatory.\n", "Try to focus as quickly as possible on the problematic words (content, or edit summary).

However, marriage to a mother's sister daughter (a parallel cousin) would be ", ", here meaning inside the same descent group, and would therefore fail to build alliances between different groups. Correspondingly, in societies like China with patrilineal descent, marriage to a father's brother's daughter would fail at alliance building. And in societies with both types of descent, where a person belongs to the group of his mother's mother and father's father but not mother's father or father's mother, only cross-cousin marriages would successfully build alliances.", "\n", "LÃ©vi-Strauss postulated that cross-cousin marriage had the two consequences of setting up classes which automatically delimit the group of possible spouses and of determining a relationship that can decide whether a prospective spouse is to be desired or excluded. Whereas in other kinship systems one or another of these aspects dominates, in cross-cousin marriage they overlap and cumulate their effects. It differs from incest prohibitions in that the latter employs a series of negative relationships, saying whom one cannot marry, while cross-cousin marriage employs positive relationships, saying whom should marry. Most crucially, cross-cousin marriage is the only type of preferential union that can function normally and exclusively and still give every man and woman the chance to marry a cross-cousin. Unlike other systems such as the levirate, the sororate, or uncle-niece marriage, cross-cousin marriage is preferential because for obvious reasons these others cannot constitute the exclusive or even preponderant rule of marriage in any group. Cross-cousin marriage divides members of the same generation into two approximately equal groups, those of cross-cousins and \"siblings\" that include real siblings and parallel cousins. Consequently, cross-cousin marriage can be a normal form of marriage in a society, but the other systems above can only be privileged forms. This makes cross-cousin marriage exceptionally important.", "\n", "Cross-cousin marriage also establishes a division between prescribed and prohibited relatives who, from the viewpoint of biological proximity, are strictly interchangeable. LÃ©vi-Strauss thought that this proved that the origin of the incest prohibition is purely social and not biological. Cross-cousin marriage in effect allowed the anthropologist to control for biological degree by studying a situation where the degree of prohibited and prescribed spouses were equal. In understanding why two relatives of the same biological degree would be treated so differently, LÃ©vi-Strauss wrote, it would be possible to understand not only the principle of cross-cousin marriage but of the incest prohibition itself. For LÃ©vi-Strauss cross-cousin marriage was not either socially arbitrary or a secondary consequence of other institutions like dual organization or the practice of exogamy. Instead, the ", " of cross-cousin marriage could be found within the institution itself.

According to some theories, in these kinship systems a man marries his matrilateral cross-cousin due to associating her with his nurturant mother. Due to this association, possibly reinforced by personal interaction with a specific cousin, he may become \"fond\" of her, rendering the relationship \"sentimentally appropriate\".", " ", " cross-cousin marriage is the rarest of all types of cousin marriage, and there is some question as to whether it even exists.", "\n", "In contrast to LÃ©vi-Strauss who viewed the exchange of women under matrilateral cross-cousin marriage as fundamentally egalitarian, anthropologist ", " held that such systems by nature created groups of junior and senior status and were part of the political structure of society.

Groups like the ", " exhibiting matrilateral cross-cousin marriage do not exchange women in circular structures; where such structures do exist they are unstable. Moreover, the exchanging groups are not major segments of the society, but rather local descent groups from the same or closely neighboring communities. LÃ©vi-Strauss held that women were always exchanged for some \"prestation\" which could either be other women or labor and material goods.
